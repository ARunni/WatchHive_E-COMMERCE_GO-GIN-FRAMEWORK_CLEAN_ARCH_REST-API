# WatchHive E-Commerce Backend Rest API

WatchHive E-Commerce Backend Rest API is a feature-rich backend solution for E-commerce applications developed using Golang with the Gin web framework. This API is designed to efficiently handle routing and HTTP requests while following best practices in code architecture and dependency management.

## Key Features

- **Clean Code Architecture**: The project follows clean code architecture principles, making it maintainable and scalable.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes the Dependency Injection design pattern for flexible component integration.
- **Compile-Time Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are managed using Wire for compile-time injection.
- **Database**: Leverages PostgreSQL for efficient and relational data storage.
- **AWS Integration**: Integrates with AWS S3 for cloud-based storage solutions.
- **E-Commerce Features**: Implements a wide range of features commonly found in e-commerce applications, including cart management,  order management, wallet, offers, and coupon management.
- **Code Quality**: Includes unit tests to maintain code quality and implements Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions.

## Deployment

- The application is hosted on AWS EC2 and is served using Nginx, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- **Containerization**: The project is containerized using Docker, and successful deployment and scaling are tested on Kubernetes.

## API Documentation

For interactive API documentation, Swagger is implemented. You can explore and test the API endpoints in real-time.

## Security

Security is a top priority for the project:

- **OTP Verification**: Twilio API is integrated for OTP verification.
- **Payment Integration**: Razorpay API is used for payment processing.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Enhances security and extends user sessions using refresh tokens.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your environment with the required dependencies, including Golang, PostgreSQL,  and Wire.
3. Configure your environment variables (e.g., database credentials, AWS keys, Twilio credentials).
4. Build and run the project.
